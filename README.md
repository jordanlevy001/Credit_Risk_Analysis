# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to compare/contrast the performance of various data modeling techniques to evaluate credit card risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification issue; good loans significantly outnumber risky loans.
For this project I used the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. I oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms. And I undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Then, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. The two libraries used in this project were imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn.
